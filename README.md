# Swift - Hello World

This is my first foray into the world of Swift.  The project has a lot of notes from the tutorial I watched to create the 
app so is fairly cluttered with comments.  Though I ended up taking a different direction for learning Swift, it seemed appropriate
to start learning with the classic Hello World project.

## Tech Used
* Xcode I
* Swift 3
